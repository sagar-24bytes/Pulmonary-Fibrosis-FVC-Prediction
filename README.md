# Pulmonary Fibrosis FVC Prediction using Deep Learning

> Early detection of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) using CT scan images and tabular clinical data, implemented with dual-branch deep learning models.

---

## 🩺 Project Overview

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease that leads to scarring (fibrosis) of the lungs and severely impacts respiratory function. This project proposes a multimodal machine learning system to predict Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) from:

- **Lung CT scan images** (DICOM → PNG)
- **Clinical tabular data** (Age, Sex, Smoking Status, etc.)

I built and evaluated two models:
-  `EFFICIENTNETB0.ipynb`
-  `MOBILENET_V3_LARGE.ipynb`

## 🧠 Methodology

### 🔹 Data Pipeline

1. **DICOM to PNG conversion**  
   - Applied lung window preprocessing and finally converted dcm to png
   - Saved 2D lung slices for model training

2. **Custom Data Generator** for parallel loading of:
   - Preprocessed CT images
   - Tabular clinical features

### 🔹 Model Architecture

- **Dual-Branch Network**:
  - CNN branch: Extracts features from CT slices
  - FCN branch: Processes clinical tabular data
  - Merged for FVC regression output

## 💾 Dataset

  Dataset which is used is from the [Kaggle OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/osic-pulmonary-fibrosis-progression), which includes:

- CT scan slices (DICOM format)
- Patient metadata (age, sex, smoking status, etc.)
- Time-stamped FVC measurements

> **Note**: Dataset is not included in this repo due to privacy constraints.
